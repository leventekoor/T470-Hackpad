# T470-Hackpad
***Tested on:*** *macOS Catalina 10.15.x*\
***Apple Services:*** *tested and working*
![macOS Catalina on the ThinkPad T470](/catalina-t470.png)
## Introduction
This was my first hackintosh project, with a lot of learning and even more unexpected errors. I have yet to find a completed T470 setup for Catalina using OpenCore, so I decided to make one for myself and share with the community. So here we are... :) As I said being a first time hackintosher I ran into a lot of problems and did a LOT of research to get my system even to boot, then slowly worked myself towards a stable system. I hope this helps anyone who has a similar T470 setup or have a shared specific hardware that they hav problems with. I try to update this repo to the best of my ability.
## Tips & Notes
- Battery life is about the same as on Windows
- Never experienced any KPs while using Catalina
- Always keep a copy of your original dissassembled DSDT. (**Only edit DSDT using MaciASL**)
  - It is adviced to keep a copy after each change so you don't have to restart from the beginning if you messed something up.
